This instruction was specified for Windows users and those who had a problem uploading the [Esp32CamAccess.ino] code to the ESP32 Cam using the ESP32 Cam Download Board
If you're on Windows 11 and you're using the ESP32 Cam Download board, you have to uninstall the USB-SERIAL CH340 driver first from Device Manager and then reinstall it because it's either outdated or overdated

To do that:
1. Firstly, connect the ESP32 Cam with the USB cable and connect it to a PC device
2. Go to: Windows search > Device Manager > Ports COM & LPT > USB-SERIAL CH340 (Right click) > Uninstall device > Attempt to remove the driver from this device (Check) > Uninstall. Make sure the USB-SERIAL CH340 is there, because if it's not, the ESP32 Cam is not detected
3. Then install the older driver version manually; CH341SER_2019.EXE should've done the job
4. Close and open again the Arduino Uno (If it was opened before)

YOU ARE SUGGESTED TO DO THESE STEPS (1-4) FREQUENTLY BECAUSE WINDOWS 11 WILL AUTOMATICALLY UPDATE THE USB-SERIAL TO ITS LATEST VERSION ON ITS OWN AT A RANDOM TIME

5. To check if the system read it, select the board and its port first. (We suggest the [AI Thinker ESP32-CAM] board). If the port is not detected, try reinstalling the driver again, then close and open the Arduino Uno again
6. After selecting board and port, go to the serial monitor and set the baud rate to 115200. See if it's sending a communication message or a signal
7. Try pushing the RST button on the ESP32 Cam Download board. If you can see it's sending a communication message or a signal, that means the ESP32 Cam on its Download board is finally read by the system
8. Set the Wi-Fi SSID and Password in the code text editor. Empty the password like "" if there's no password
9. Before uploading, press and hold the IO0 button and then press the RST button (like screenshotting on your phone) to make the ESP32 Cam enter the download mode to upload the code into the ESP32 Cam
10. Compile and upload the code like usual. If it's not working, try using another board of the same kind, e.g., [ESP32-WROOM-DA Module]

11. After the upload is done, go to the serial monitor and set the baud rate to 115200
12. Press the RST button on the download board to initiate the code and generate the IP address API WebServer
13. If it's showing the IP address, then the IP address can now be accessible and used in the Python code (py)
14. Done
