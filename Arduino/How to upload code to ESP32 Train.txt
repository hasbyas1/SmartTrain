How to upload [Esp32TrainControl.ino] code to ESP32 Train:
1. To check if the system reads the device, select the board and its port first. (We suggest the [ESP32-WROOM-DA Module] board). If the port is not detected, try reinstalling the driver again, then close and open the Arduino Uno again
2. After selecting board and port, go to the serial monitor and set the baud rate to 115200. See if it's sending a communication message or a signal
3. Try pushing the RST or BOOT button on the ESP32. If you can see it's sending a communication message or a signal, that means the ESP32 Cam on its Download board is finally read by the system
4. Set the Wi-Fi SSID and Password in the code text editor. Empty the password like "" if there's no password
5. Compile and upload the code like usual. If it's not working, try using another board of the same kind, e.g., [ESP32-Dev Module]

6. After the upload is done, go to the serial monitor and set the baud rate to 115200
7. Press the RST or BOOT button on the ESP32 to initiate the code and generate the IP address API WebServer
8. If it's showing the IP address, then the IP address can now be accessible and used in the Python code (py)
9. Done
